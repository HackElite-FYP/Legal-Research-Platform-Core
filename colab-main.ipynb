            "Title: eventually amounts to the interference with the course of justice or the abuse of process of court. In Vijitha Herath v. Secretary to the Treasury SC Contempt 2 -2023 dated 14.11.2023, the Supreme Court has referred to the case of Mudiyanselage Vijit Reginald Perera v. The King 52 NLR 293 in which the definition of contempt has been defined as follows; “There must be involved some act done or writing published calculated to bring a Court or a judge of the Court into contempt or to lower its authority, or something calculated to obstruct or interfere with the due course of justice or the lawful process of the Courts. (see Reg v. Gray 1900 2 Q.B. 36.)” The Supreme Court in the same judgment has referred to the below paragraphs of the case of Croos and Another vs Dabrera (1999) 1 SLR 205: - “The charge of contempt of Court was classically defined in the case of Regina vs Kopito by Goodman J as “the scandalizing of the Court”, in that the words or the acts are likely to bring the Court and the Judges in to disrepute. The action taken with regard to acts of contempt is based on the premises that a well regulated law of a civilized community cannot be sustained without sanctions being imposed for such conduct. It is therefore thought important to maintain the respect and dignity of the Court and its officers, whose task is to uphold and enforce the law, because without such respect, public faith in the administration of justice would be undermined and the law itself would fall into disrepute”. The Supreme Court in the said judgement has further observed that, “even if contempt is not always a crime, it bears a criminal character and therefore, it must be satisfactorily proved”. Tilakawardena J. in the said Croos and Another case has held that the offence of contempt of court under our law is a criminal charge and the burden of proof is that of proof beyond reasonable doubt. We observe that the ‘Contempt of a Court, Tribunal or Institution Act No. 8 of 2024\n",

            "Title: or where there is some other remedy available (Mapalathan v. Elayavan 41 NLR 115). It is a remedy which is granted under exceptional circumstances and the power of court should be most cautiously and sparingly exercised, (Perera v. Wijewickrama 15 NLR 411). A party seeking restitution must act with utmost promptitude, Babun Appu v. Simon Appu 11 NLR 115, (Menchinahamy v. Munaweera 52 NLR 411), and before a change has taken place in the position of the parties, (Sinnethamby v. Nallathamby 7 NLR 139). Where there has been negligence on the part of the applicant seeking relief or his attorney-at-law, restitution will not be granted, (Wickremasooriya v. Abeywardene 15 NLR 472). The party invoking the extraordinary powers of this court must display honesty and frankness. Thus where a party by its own conduct has acquiesced in or approbated the defective proceedings, court will not exercise its discretion to set aside the impugned proceedings. For it is not the function of court in the exercise of its jurisdiction in restitution to relieve the parties of the consequences of their own folly, negligence or laches, (Don Lewis v. Dissanayake 70 NLR 8)” Therefore, in the absence of these stringent conditions, we must refrain from utilizing this extraordinary measure, adhering instead to the ordinary legal processes and remedies available within the framework of civil litigation. None of the grounds mentioned above do not fall within the scope of restitutio in integrum. All these grievances could have been remedied by an appeal to the Supreme Court. In the matter at hand, learned district judge of Polonnaruwa has dismissed the application on 10th of March 2022 and being aggrieved by the said decision the Petitioner has appealed to the Civil Appeal High Court of Anuradhapura and the learned judges of the said court also have dismissed the application.

The Learned High Court Judge after considering the facts pertinent to this action had dismissed the Appellant’s revision application. On that, the Appellant had filed this appeal against the said order made by the Learned High Court Judge. 7) The contention of the Appellant is that he did not receive the quit notice as the registered postal articles were not annexed to the application submitted to the Magistrate’s Court. 8) Further, the Learned High Court Judge had not considered the deeds executed in favour of the Appellant which were produced and had failed to adhere to the provisions outlined in the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979\n",

This is an application preferred by the accused-petitioner-petitioners (hereinafter referred to as the petitioners) seeking to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction granted to this Court in terms of Article 138 of The Constitution. When this matter was supported for notice, after having considered the relevant facts, circumstances and the law, this Court issued notices on the respondent- respondents mentioned in the application. Accordingly, the respondents were represented and they were allowed to file objections, if necessary. At the hearing of this application, this Court heard the submissions of the learned President’s Counsel in support of the application, as well as the submissions of the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG), who represented the complainant-respondent-respondent and the 2nd respondent-respondent, namely, the Hon. Attorney General. It was agreed by the parties that this matter could be considered along with case number CPA-0086-23 filed before this Court, as both the applications have been based on similar facts and circumstances. This is a matter where the petitioners were charged before the Magistrate’s Court of Anuradhapura under Case Number 94695 on the basis that they violated section 34(1)(a) and/or section 34(1)(b) of the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol Act No. 27 of 2006\n",

The Petitioner has instituted this action seeking writs of Certiorari and Prohibition challenging the decision of the Respondents, to cancel the registration of the Craig Estate Tea Factory, which is owned and operated by the Petitioner. The Petitioner seeks the annulment of this decision and an order prohibiting the Respondents from imposing restrictions on licensed tea brokers regarding the sale of tea produced by the factory. The dispute arose following a surprise inspection carried out by the Respondents on 17 July 2020, during which tea samples were collected. The Respondents alleged that these samples contained ferrous sulphate above allowable limits. This inspection led to an inquiry on 14 August 2020, which concluded with the cancellation of the factory’s registration under Section 8(2) of the Tea Control Act No. 51 of 1957\n",

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the petitioner has preferred an appeal in terms of Article 154P of The Constitution to the Provincial High Court of the North Western Province holden in Kurunegala. The learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of the North Western Province holden in Kurunegala, after having heard the appeal, has dismissed the same by the judgment dated 12-10-2023, on the basis that there exists no reason to interfere with the conviction and the sentence of the petitioner by the learned Magistrate of Pilassa. The petitioner has preferred this application in revision seeking to challenge the above-mentioned judgment of learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of the North Western Province holden in Kurunegala, as well as the conviction of him by the learned Magistrate of Pilassa, on the basis that he has exceptional grounds to challenge the said judgments by invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court. The remedy for a person who is dissatisfied of a judgment pronounced by a Judge of the Provincial High Court exercising the appellate jurisdiction granted in terms of Article 154P of The Constitution has been statutorily provided in High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990\n",

            "Title: Development was created and the Petitioner had called for Applications to fill the said position. The 2nd Respondent who had been employed in the Petitioner Institution from 2001 had not applied for the said position. The 2nd Respondent subsequently received several promotions, and prior to the restructuring, he was serving as the Deputy Director Management. The 2nd Respondent on several occasions complained to the Department of Labour about the purported injustice caused to the 2nd Respondent pursuant to the restructuring and the creation of new designations. The 2nd Respondent had complained to the Labour Officer who had dismissed the complaint after inquiry on the ground of not having any merit in the said complaint. However, as the dispute continued between the parties, the 2nd Respondent had requested for another inquiry after the initial inquiry conducted by the Department that determined that there was no injustice caused to the 2nd Respondent. Thus, the Minister of Labour by an Order made under Section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act as amended by the Industrial Disputes (Special Provisions) Act, No. 37 of 1968\n",

At the Debt Conciliation Board, a settlement was entered on 18-12- 2019, between the petitioner and respondent in terms of Section 30, 31 of the Debt Conciliation Board Ordinance. The petitioner agreed to pay the agreed amount as per the settlement to the respondent on or before 11-07- 2020. It was further agreed that in the event the petitioner failed to pay the due amount as per the settlement, the respondent is entitled to auction the property described in the schedule to the said deed, in terms of the provisions under section 43 of the Debt Conciliation Board Ordinance and the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code. On an application of the petitioner, the time for repayment was extended until 11-01-2021 by the Debt Conciliation Board. The respondent filed an application before the District Court of Horana on the basis that the petitioner had failed to repay the money in accordance with the settlement entered before the Debt Conciliation Board. After considering the respondent's application, the Learned District Judge of Horana issued a decree nisi allowing the respondent's application. After inter-party inquiry, decree nisi was made absolute. Section 44 of the Debt Conciliation Board Ordinance as amended is as follows; (1) If on or before the date appointed by the court under section 43, the debtor fails to prove to the satisfaction of the court that there has been no default on his part in complying with the terms of the settlement, the decree nisi entered under section 43 shall by order of the court be made absolute. (2) Any decree which has been made absolute under subsection (1) may be executed as if it were a decree entered in a civil action, and the court may award to the petitioner the costs of the application under section 43 and of the execution of the decree, and the provisions of the Stamp Ordinance or the Stamp Duty Act, No. 43 of 1982\n",

            "Title: said mosque to the petitioners. The petitioners’ position is that the handing over of the administration took place in a very cordial manner, and the 1st respondent addressed the Jamaat (congregation) by public announcement apparatus and wished the petitioners well. However, on the very next date, 23-03-2023, the appellant-respondent, one of the special Trustees whose term had expired long ago, filed an appeal to the Wakfs Tribunal against the order of Wakfs Board dated 14-03-2023. The Wakfs Tribunal granted an ex-parte stay order restraining the petitioner from managing the Mosque. Further, the Tribunal ordered the issuance of notice on the petitioners’ returnable on 13-05-2023, which is seven weeks later than the date of the stay order. The petitioners’ position is that having obtained an ex-parte stay order the respondents attempted to take control and manage the Mosque. However, the Jamaat had revolted, a tense situation arose, and the breach of peace ensued. The petitioners further state that they appeared before the Tribunal on 01.04.2023. However, proceedings were terminated without giving them a fair hearing on a purported settlement. After that, the petitioners filed this application before this court on 04-04- 2023. Considering the petition, affidavit documents and the submissions made on behalf of the petitioners, this court issued an interim order as prayed for in paragraph (c) of the prayer to the petition. The respondents have filed their objections to the petitioners’ application and took up several preliminary objections. After inquiry, this court overruled the respondents' preliminary objections and extended the interim order until the final determination of this application. The petitioners have submitted that since the appellant-respondent was not a party before the Wakfs Board and therefore, has no locus standi to file an appeal before the Wakfs Tribunal. The petitioners specifically pleaded in their petition that the appellant before the Tribunal was not a party before the Board. However, the respondents have omitted to answer that. The petitioners have also submitted that the order made on 23-03-2023 by the Wakfs Tribunal is contrary to the provisions of the Muslim Mosque and Charitable Trust or Wakfs Act No. 51 of 1956\n",

Further, it was held that a financial loss of Rs. 6,757,818/- had been caused to the Petitioner by the third Respondent, and therefore, the third Respondent's gratuity amounting to Rs. 2,677,434.80/- would be set off against the said amount, with the remaining balance of Rs. 4,080,383.20/- to be payable in three monthly installments within thirty days of receipt of the disciplinary order.
